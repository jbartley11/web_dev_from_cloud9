refactoring routes in index.js
auth, comments, campgrounds - groups
split out into separate files and then require them in index.js

make new directory routes in project root
create js files for campgrounds, comments, index(for routes not related to model)
c9 on directory will open up all files in folder

use express router
in separate files
require express
var router = express.Router();
replace all app. with route.
have to export at end of file:
module.exports = router;

in index.js:
var indexRoutes = require("./routes/index");
app.use(indexRoutes); // do near bottom

can add beginning of url in the app.use method since all routes within separated files
all share the common beginning. campground/:id, campgrounds, campground/
app.use("/campgrounds/", commentRoutes);
in campgrounds file - /campgrounds changes to just /

when including a param it doesn't come through unless you do
in comments.js
var router = express.Router({mergeParams: true});


user associations comment
remove name on form and have it come from username
comment schema
author: {
    id: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: "User"
    },
    username: String
}

in create comment route(post):
comment.author.username = req.user.username;
comment.author.id = req.user._id;
comment.save();

in seed, comment out everything after removing campgrounds
run to remove everything
then uncomment in seeds.js
but then comment the function call out of index.js

users and campgrounds
user must be signed in to submit a new campground
save username and id to new campground

in campgrounds route
don't want user to see new campground form or be able to post new campground
use isLoggedIn middleware in campground routes we want to protect

adding author info to campground
in campgrounds model
add author object
in campgrounds route
in post route
campground.author.username = req.user.username;
campground.author.id = req.user._id;
campground.save();

update campground show.ejs to display username on site
